Once upon a time, in a land far far away, Dr. Mehlhase was stranded on top of Schloss Eltz.
Dr. Mehlhase's only companion was her hund named Swartz. 
Luckily, she was able to go down to her Ratskeller so she did not starve.
At the Ratskeller she would always order her favorite dessert, apfelkuchen.
