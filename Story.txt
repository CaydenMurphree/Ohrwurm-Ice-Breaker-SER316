Once upon a time, in a land far far away, Dr. Mehlhase was stranded on top of Schloss Eltz.
Dr. Mehlhase's only companion was her hund named Swartz. 
Luckily, she was able to go down to her Ratskeller so she did not starve.
At the Ratskeller she would always order her favorite dessert, apfelkuchen.
For Dr. Mehlhase's hund she would order a bratwurst, later in the night Swartz disappeared.
Dr. Mehlhase heard a engine start, turns out Swartz found a Porsche bit into the wheel causing the Porche to start its engine.
